# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I have been working in IT for the last ten years and I was looking to challenge myself and take my knowledge to the next level. At the same time, the IT industry is heading towards a more code-based implementation on all levels and in all departments. This project marks my first foray into web development. This project gave me the chance to practice skills as I learned them, and be able to have something to show for the knowledge I have learned so far. I have learned the basics of how to structure, style, and interact with a webpage by using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Usage

Each section of the Prework Study Guide Webpage contains notes on each subject that I added to remind myself of some important things to remember when adding the different elements to your webpage. Also, if you open the DevTools console you can see the JavaScript running. It will show you a list of topics, and even suggest randomly a topic to study first!
